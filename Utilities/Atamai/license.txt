DERIVATIVE PRODUCTS: Software created by LICENSEE which contain/incorporate
the SOFTWARE or any portion thereof in binary or source-code form, except

II.  	Conditions of Use

terms and conditions of this Agreement a license to use and modify the
SOFTWARE and to create DERIVATIVE PRODUCTS for LICENSEE's non-commercial

c)	LICENSEE agrees that any AFFILIATE utilizing the SOFTWARE will be
advised of, and is subject to, the conditions in this agreement.

d)	None of the SOFTWARE provided or DERIVATIVE PRODUCTS may be used
for commercial purposes or development unless a release, option or license
granting such permission is executed between ATAMAI and LICENSEE.  ATAMAI
shall consider requests for a license that permits commercial use if there
is interest in the commercialization of the SOFTWARE or DERIVATIVE PRODUCTS
or in a confirmation test using the SOFTWARE or DERIVATIVE PRODUCTS.

III.	Warranties and Liability

a)	The SOFTWARE and related know-how are not intended for therapeutic
